You're late!
We have a very important delivery to make.
Mr. Henderson wants the New England clam Chowder with a side of iced tea.
We got the order, now we gotta deliver.
He lives in one of the corners of the town, i forget which one. 
Move along now we don't want the order to get cold.
Remember He's in the corner of town.
Why are you still here?
